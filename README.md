# wallet-credit-scoring-aave-v2
This project assigns credit scores (0â€“1000) to wallets based on transaction data from the Aave V2 protocol. It uses behavior analysis of actions like deposit, borrow, repay, redeem, and liquidation to rank wallets by reliability. Outputs include a score CSV, distribution chart, and detailed behavioral analysis.
